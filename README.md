# FakeNewsDetection:

## Introduction:
Welcome to the Fake News Detection project repository! 
This project aims to detect and classify fake news articles using various machine learning methods and models. We have explored a wide range of 
techniques, including Bi-LSTM, BERT, GloVe Embeddings, Recurrent Neural Networks, Random Forest, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and XGBoost-CatBoost, with
a special focus on leveraging the power of RoBERTa for enhanced accuracy and performance.

## Dataset:
We used a diverse dataset of labelled news articles to train and evaluate our models. The dataset contains both real and fake news samples, enabling us to 
build a robust and reliable detection system.

## Methodology:
In this project, we followed a comprehensive approach to fake news detection, combining both traditional machine learning algorithms 
and state-of-the-art deep learning models. Each method was carefully implemented, and we fine-tuned hyperparameters to achieve the best results.
The methods explored in this project include:
 - **Bi-LSTM:** A bidirectional LSTM model that captures sequential patterns in the text data.
 - **BERT:** Pre-trained contextual language embeddings that offer a contextual understanding of words in sentences.
 - **GloVe Embeddings:** Pre-trained word vectors based on global word co-occurrence statistics.
 - **Recurrent Neural Networks:** Utilizing RNNs to capture temporal dependencies in the text.
 - **Random Forest:** A powerful ensemble learning technique for classification tasks.
 - **Multinomial Naive Bayes:** A probabilistic algorithm for classification, particularly suited for text data.
 - **XGBoost-CatBoost:** Gradient boosting models that excel in handling tabular data.
